### StreamingFast Firehose Solana Types

Protobuf definitions when dealing with Firehose Solana chain(s) like Solana Mainnet.

Foremost, this provides [sf.solana.types.v1.Block](https://buf.build/streamingfast/firehose-solana/docs/main:sf.solana.type.v1#sf.solana.type.v1.Block) which is used for consuming Firehose & Substreams Solana block model.

This is probably the only model you should really care about, the rest are meant for internal communications for Firehose operators.
